# Neuron-Synapse-Prediction
Using machine learning to predict whether a synapse will be formed based on axonal-dendritic proximity

The Goal:

       When the axon of one neuron comes close to the dendrite of another neuron, we call this an axonal-dendritic proximity, or ADP. Every synapse results from an ADP, but not every ADP results in a synapse. When the ADP contains a synapse, we say the ADP has been ”converted” to a synapse. It is of major interest to neuroscience what rules determine whether ADP’s will convert to a synapse. In other words, what drives neurons to connect to each other, given that are within proximity (i.e. physically close enough)? The machine learning task is to predict whether an ADP results in a synapse, and is hence a binary classification problem. There are many, many more ADPs that do not result in a synapse, however, resulting in unbalanced classes.
